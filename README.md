# Chart the Stock Market
### "Chart the Stock Market" is a project required for freeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certificate:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/chart-the-stock-market

**Date Completed: September 16, 2017**

See the project on Heroku at: https://charmed-cash.herokuapp.com/

>1. **Objective**: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

>2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

>3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

>4. **User Story**: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

>5. **User Story**: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

>6. **User Story**: I can remove stocks.

>7. **User Story**: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

>8. Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.

>9. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
